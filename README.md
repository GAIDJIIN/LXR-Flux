# ‚ö° LXRFlux ‚Äì Real-Time GPU-Based Lighting Analysis for Unreal Engine

**LXRFlux** is a cutting-edge Unreal Engine plugin that captures, analyzes, and interprets **HDR lighting** on the GPU ‚Äî in real-time ‚Äî with near-zero overhead.

Developed by the creator of [**LXR**](https://docs.clusterfact.games/docs/LXR).
LXRFlux is a lightweight, insanely fast subsystem built entirely on **render thread** execution and **RDG-based GPU compute shaders**. This is **next-level light detection** ‚Äî perfect for stealth mechanics, dynamic gameplay, adaptive visuals, and more.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **True HDR Scene Analysis** from SceneCaptureComponent2D
- ‚ö° **Runs entirely on the Render Thread** ‚Äî ultra-low CPU overhead
- üéØ **Accurate indirect & direct light detection**
- üìà Outputs **Max Luminance**, **Average Luminance**, and **RGB Color**
- üîÅ **Real-time updates every frame** or on demand
- üî¨ Built using **Unreal‚Äôs RDG system** and **compute shaders**
- üß™ Includes debug logs, smoothing buffer, and plug-and-play architecture
- üõ†Ô∏è 100% Blueprint and C++ compatible

---

## üöÄ Use Cases

- üåó Stealth mechanics
- üî• Light-based environmental triggers (e.g., blind from a flashbang)
- üß± Adaptive materials or visibility effects

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Two SceneCaptures** (Top & Bottom view)
2. Custom **RDG Compute Shader** samples the HDR data
3. GPU accumulates:
   - Max Luminance
   - Encoded RGB
   - Count of bright pixels (thresholded)
4. Results are **read back once the GPU fence is complete**
5. Output is smoothed using `TCircularHistoryBuffer`
6. Final results are available to Blueprint/C++ for gameplay logic

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repo where ever you want.:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zurra/LXR-Flux.git
   ```

### üîß Building the Project

This repository does **not** include precompiled binaries by default, so you‚Äôll need to build them locally. Make sure you have all the necessary Unreal Engine C++ prerequisites installed (Visual Studio, UE5 source access, etc).

Once cloned, simply open the `FPTemplate.uproject` file to begin the build process. Unreal will automatically generate project files and start compiling the code.

> üí° Prebuilt binaries are available for your convenience and can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/zurra/LXR-Flux/releases/tag/release).  
> These binaries include both the plugin and the sample project, and they are built for **Unreal Engine 5.5.4**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're using a different engine version, it's strongly recommended to build from source to ensure compatibility.

## üöÄ How to Use LXRFlux

LXRFlux is plug-and-play and can be used in both **Blueprints** and **C++** with minimal setup.

---

### üß© In Blueprints

1. **Add the Component**
   - Open your Actor Blueprint.
   - Click **Add Component** ‚Üí Search for `LXRFluxComponent`.
   - Select it to attach the real-time lighting detector to your actor.

   üé• ![AddComponent](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4644ce44-26a2-4878-a474-dd85c3f81856)


2. **Access the Data**
   Use these exposed variables in your Blueprint logic:

   - `Luminance` *(float)* ‚Äì Brightness of the brightest area in view.
   - `Color` *(FLinearColor)* ‚Äì Average color from visible indirect/direct light.

### üß† In C++

1. **Add the Component in Your Header (.h):**
   ```cpp
   UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "LXR")
   class ULXRFluxComponent* FluxComponent;
   ```

2. **Create It in Your Constructor (.cpp):**
   ```cpp
   FluxComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject<ULXRFluxComponent>(TEXT("LXRFlux"));
   FluxComponent->SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
   ```

3. **Read Lighting Data Anywhere:**
   ```cpp
   float CurrentLuminance = FluxComponent->Luminance;
   FLinearColor CurrentColor = FluxComponent->Color;
   ```

## üß† About the Author

Developed by [Lord Zurra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannes-v%C3%A4is%C3%A4nen-2194403) ‚Äì the creator of [**LXR**](https://docs.clusterfact.games/docs/LXR), the most advanced light detection plugin for Unreal Engine.

**LXRFlux** is a spin-off project from the LXR system, designed to be **open-source, accessible**, and perfect for devs wanting **GPU-level light awareness** in their game.

### üß† LXR vs LXRFlux ‚Äì What's the Difference?

| Feature                        | **LXR** | **LXRFlux** |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Detection Type**            | Precise world space *line-traced* light exposure | GPU-averaged HDR scene luminance |
| **Accuracy**                  | Ultra-precise, based on *actual visibility* | Fast approximation via scene capture |
| **Performance**               | Heavier (raycasts, async traces) | Lightweight (pure GPU compute) |
| **Data Granularity**          | Per-AI, Per-Frame, Shadow Silhouettes | Scene-wide average or max values |
| **Use Case**                  | Stealth AI, exposure-based detection, silhouette vision | Ambient lighting checks, visual triggers, global feedback |
| **Post-Processing Aware**     | Yes (before and after PP)        | Yes (via CaptureSource settings) |
| **Extensibility**             | Plugin with deep gameplay integration | Open-source tool, plug-and-play |
| **Core Focus**                | *Perception realism and AI awareness* | *Fast, reactive environmental sensing* |

   - **LXR** is a complete AI perception ultimate light detection framework with line-traced lighting, memory of light states, beam visibility, and player silhouette detection.
 
   - **LXRFlux** is your GPU-powered light radar, ideal for lightweight sensing and ambient triggers.
